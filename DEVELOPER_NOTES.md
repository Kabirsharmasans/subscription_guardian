Tasks completed:

- Added new dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` (hive, hive_flutter, flutter_local_notifications, timezone, flutter_native_timezone, intl, url_launcher, jiffy, csv, file_picker).
- Added `lib/models/subscription.dart` using `jiffy` for robust renewal date calculation.
- Integrated native Android home screen widget using the `home_widget` plugin.

Next steps to validate locally:

1. Fetch packages:

```cmd
cd "c:\Projects\SG project (Completed)\SubscriptionGuardian"
flutter pub get
```

2. Generate Hive type adapter for `Subscription`:

```cmd
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will create `lib/models/subscription.g.dart`. If you prefer continuous generation while developing, use:

```cmd
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

3. Run the app or tests to ensure everything compiles.

4. For the Android widget:
- Ensure `home_widget: ^0.5.0` is in your `pubspec.yaml` (already done).
- Call `WidgetService.updateWidget()` after any subscription changes (add/update/delete).
- Build a debug/release APK and add the widget to your Android home screen.

Notes:
- The repository currently did not contain an existing `lib/models/subscription.dart`; the new file references `part 'subscription.g.dart'`, which must be generated by the build_runner step above.
- If you encounter SDK or package version conflicts, try running `flutter pub outdated` and adjust versions accordingly.
- iOS widgets require Swift/SwiftUI native implementation and App Groups for communication, which are not covered in this guide.
